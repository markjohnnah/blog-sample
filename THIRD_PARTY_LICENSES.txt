                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and 
Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") 
of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of 
contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public 
can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in 
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any 
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the 
Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and 
scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the 
use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional 
consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the 
extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects 
to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or 
her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on 
those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and 
related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in 
paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national 
implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or 
treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, 
Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and 
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of 
action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of 
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by 
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium 
and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation 
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the 
benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and 
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, 
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of 
the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid 
or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent 
permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent 
the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non 
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise 
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the 
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in 
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, 
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The 
License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should 
any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable 
law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, 
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her 
remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes 
of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of 
Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or 
otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning 
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of 
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of 
latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not 
discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work 
or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the 
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions 
or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has 
no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE 
("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF 
THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS 
OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS 
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, 
such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a 
literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or 
any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form 
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not 
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and 
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than 
works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their 
contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in 
unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and 
independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes 
of this License.
c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or 
Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under 
the terms of this License.
e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, 
individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be 
identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, 
musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or 
otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a 
phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance 
or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the 
broadcast.
f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including 
without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be 
the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other 
writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or 
dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition 
with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process 
analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or 
lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to 
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work 
relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a 
phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work 
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary 
or artistic work.
g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously 
violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission 
from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the 
public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or 
public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of 
the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to 
perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the 
performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the 
Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound 
or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including 
storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses 
free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in 
connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) 
license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce 
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation 
in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that 
changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original 
work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work 
has been modified.";
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
e. For the avoidance of doubt:
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor 
reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights 
granted under this License;
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives 
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under 
this License; and,
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether 
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that 
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights 
granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to 
exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly 
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by 
the following restrictions:
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must 
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of 
the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that 
restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. 
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties 
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly 
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict 
the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient 
under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a 
Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject 
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, 
to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as 
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, 
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the 
Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original 
Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor 
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for 
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other 
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) 
to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated 
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for 
the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit 
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by 
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required 
by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the 
case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all 
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in 
a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance 
of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in 
the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly 
or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original 
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, 
without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or 
Attribution Parties.
c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by 
applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as 
part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor 
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of 
the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed 
to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original 
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, 
to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably 
exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not 
otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND 
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY 
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE 
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL 
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE 
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by 
You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or 
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided 
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the 
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the 
right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any 
time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any 
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and 
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to 
the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You 
under this License.
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a 
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under 
this License.
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not 
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without 
further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless 
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver 
or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the 
Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear 
in any communication from You.
e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted 
utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, 
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as 
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction 
in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of 
the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite 
of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this 
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not 
intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

2. License Grants and Conditions
2.1. Grants
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:
     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
        as part of a Larger Work; and
     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
        Contributions or its Contributor Version.
2.2. Effective Date
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
     distributes such Contribution.
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
     Contributor:
     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
2.5. Representation
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
2.6. Fair Use
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
     equivalents.
2.7. Conditions
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.
3. Responsibilities
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
     Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).
3.4. Notices
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.
8. Litigation
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License
10.1. New Versions
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.
10.2. Effect of New Versions
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.
10.3. Modified Versions
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
      such modified license differs from this License).
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
      attached.
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
      This Source Code Form is "Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses", as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)
Preamble
The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement
intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database
subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.
Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not
the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish
to use this license together with another license for the contents.
Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.
The Licensor (as defined below)
and
You (as defined below)
agree as follows:
1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words
"Collective Database" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part
of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective
Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.
"Convey" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.
"Contents" - The contents of this Database, which includes the
information, independent works, or other material collected into the
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.
"Database" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic
or other means offered under the terms of this License.
"Database Directive" - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
of databases, as amended or succeeded.
"Database Right" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui
generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.
"Derivative Database" - Means a database based upon the Database, and
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
Database.
"Extraction" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in
any form.
"License" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.

2.0 What this License covers
2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:
  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
  b. A license of the Database Right; and
  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.
2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
Database, including:
  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
  Contents stored in the Database;
  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and
  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
  use on this access as outlined in this License.
2.3 Rights not covered.
  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
  or operation of the Database;
  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
  Database; and
  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
  Database.
2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.
3.0 Rights granted
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future.
The rights granted cover, for example:
  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
  the Contents;
  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;
  c. Creation of Collective Databases;
  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and
  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
  Databases.
3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
  of the rights granted under this License;
  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
  the rights granted under this License; and,
  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License.
3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.
4.0 Conditions of Use
4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
in material breach of its terms.
4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
must:
  a. Do so only under the terms of this License;
  b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;
  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices
  that refer to this License; and
  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
  look for it.
4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.
  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under
  Section 4.3:
        Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available
        under the ODC Attribution License.
DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the location of the Database. "ODC Attribution License"
should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URI's with the above notice.
4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.
5.0 Moral rights
5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or
any other derogatory treatment:
  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
  10.4;
  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
  Section 10.4; and
  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.
Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.
6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
Database, including without limitation:
  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
  or judicial procedure.
  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
Contents.
7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
this exclusion may not apply to You.
8.0 Limitation of liability
8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.
8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
the part of the Licensor.
9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
survive any termination of this License.
9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor
will not terminate Your rights under it.
9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.
9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
will be reinstated:
  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th
  day after cessation of breach;
  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or
  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.
10.0 General
10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law.
10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Database.
10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
breach by the Licensor.
10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
  exercising permissions granted by this License.

  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
  source, and configuration files.

  and conversions to other media types.

  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
